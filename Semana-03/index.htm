                            Our solution has several reports that can be generated, including a report on the work hours
                            of each employee in each project and work team.
                            This report can be used to track employee productivity and to identify any areas where employees may be slacking off.

                        Our software has helped us to improve our resource management by allowing employees 
                        to log their work hours in a central location.
                        This has made it easier for managers to track employee productivity and identify areas where improvements can be made.

                        The app will allow each employee to log in and select the project they are working on and the work team they are part of.
                        They will then be able to select the hours they worked and submit them. The app will then calculate
                        the total hours worked for each employee and project.
